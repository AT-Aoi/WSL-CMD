# WSL-CMD

Hi. I am new to shell scripting and I make this tool to run `cmd` on WSL.

# Installation

Simply copy the executable file `cmd` to your bin directory.

```bash
$ sudo cp cmd /usr/bin
```

# Usage

1. Run interactively with no command line arguments:

```bash
$ cmd
```

2. Run one command:

```bash
$ cmd echo %USERPROFILE%
```
